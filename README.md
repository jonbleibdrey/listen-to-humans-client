Reflection
What was the context for this project? 
This was to help people find any book they want from googles api.


What did you set out to build?
I created this sight originally to be a audible for regular people. so you would be able to record books straight from sight and allow others to listen to them. With the new mac m1 i couldn't get my backend to host so i ended up scratching it and doing a api book search instead.

Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
I learned so much from this because I felt i was challenged every way possible. from reading data that is passed back from backend or api. To also implement npm packages and over all searching for solutions.

What were some unexpected obstacles?
my m1 mac not being configured for heroku, it was a sad day.

What tools did you use to implement this project?
At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 4.0, Javascript, and a significant amount Bootstrap, and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
